# frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio - Alex Tan
This is my modification of the mobile portfolio project from the Udacity frontend-nanodegree.

## How to Install & Run
Download the zip file or clone the [repo](https://github.com/atan009/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio).<br>
Open the index.html to view the webpage.

## Optimizations Made
Optimized profile pic, pizzeria pic and perfmatters.js<br>
Removed Google font<br>
Changed sliding pizza loop to display only the amount of pizzas that fit the page<br>
Moved var dx and newwidth out of changepizzaslices for loop as it only needs to be run once.<br>
Removed Google Analytics scripts<br>
Added media print query for print.css in index.html<br>
Added Async to scripts<br>
Inlined styles.css
